//difference between main() and main(args: Array<String>)













//remember in 9 we had two main function in our stacktrace?!
//thats because we were keep using main() without a parameter!


//fun main() {
//
//}


//fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//
//}





//when you use main() kotlin will create another main with args and calls your main from it
//so thats the trick it uses
